# Turing Complete

<p align="center"><img alt="Logo" src="./assets/tc_logo.jpg" /></p>

Turing Complete is a [game available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/). The goal is to build a turing complete computer by combining various logic gates together. It essentially teaches how computers work at the lowest level in a fun and simple way.

The game starts with simple logic gates. With logic gates we can start building components which are then used to build a six 8-bit register CPU with four different modes (immediate, copy, calculate and condition). A custom Assembly language will assist in programming the computer.

I have documented my process of solving these challenges in this repository. I try to build the components as clean and "idiomatic" as possible, though I'm surely no expert in computer architecture and engineering.
